"""Lite-form (single-host Docker Compose) environment lifecycle.

Builds the images and brings up / tears down the Lite compose stack: PostgreSQL +
axisml-core (System modules, :8090) + axisml-platform (API + SPA, :8080). Driven
from ``setup.cli`` via ``test-setup --mode lite`` / ``test-teardown --mode lite``.

Lite has no Kubernetes and is fixed to a single static tenant (``default``), but
it ships the Platform layer and UI, so the admin is seeded (password reset to the
suite's known credential) just like the Standard form.
